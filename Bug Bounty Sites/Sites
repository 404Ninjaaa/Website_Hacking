OSINT Tools & Techniques for the Dark Web
As OSINT investigators, collectors, and analysts, all must be familiar with the dark web and be able
to navigate it with efficiency, as well as steer clear of dangers. We also have to be able to extract
information from it, about a targeted, in an efficient manner. These tools can be used to get started
and get you comfortable inspecting the dark web.
